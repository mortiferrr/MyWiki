## Правила
1) Мы используем возвратные местоимения (myself, himself, yorself и т.д.) когда субъект и объект — одно и то же.
**Пример:** Steve (subject) introduced himself (object) to the other quests.
Возвратные местоимения бывают:
* **Одиночные** (-self): myself, yourself, himself/herself/itself.
* **Множественные** (-selves): ourselves, yourselves, themselves.
**Примеры**:
I don't want you to pay for me. I'll pay for myself.
Amy had a great holliday. She really enjoyed herself.
Do you talk to yourself sometimes?
If you want more to eat, help yourselves.

2) Мы не используем возвратные местоимения после слов feel/relax/concentrate/meet.
**Примеры:**
I feel nervous. I can't relax.
You need to concentrate.
What time shall we meet tomorrow?

3) Обычно возвратные местоимения не используются после слов wash/shave/dress.
**Пример:** He got up, washed, shaved and dressed.

4) Сравним -selves и each other.
* Kate and Joe stood in front of the mirror and looked at themselves.
* Kate looked at Joe, and Joe looked ad Kate. They looked at each other.
Также можно использовать one another вместо each other.
**Примеры:**
How long have you and Ben know each other (one another)?
Sue and Alice don't like each other (one another).
Do they live near each other (one another)?

5) Возвратные местоимения также могут использоваться для подчеркивания самостоятельности субъекта.
**Примеры:**
'Who repaired your bike?' 'I repaired it myself'.
Let's paint the house ourselves. It will be much cheaper.
The film itself wasn't very good, but I loved the music.
I don't think Lisa will get the job she applied for. Lisa dosen't think so herself (Lisa herself dosen't think so).
